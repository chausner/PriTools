## Conventions and Data Types

The following abbreviations for data types are used:

Abbreviation | Description
-------------|------------
byte         | unsigned 8-bit integer
uint16       | unsigned 16-bit integer
uint32       | unsigned 32-bit integer
char         | 8-bit ASCII character

wcharz       | zero-terminated UTF-16LE Unicode string
char[16]     | ASCII string with fixed length

Unless noted otherwise, indices are zero-based. Bits are numbered from zero onwards starting with the least-significant bit.

## File Structure

The overall file structure of Package Resource Index files consists of a header, a table of contents, a number of sections and a footer. The table of contents, every section and the footer must be aligned to a multiple of 8 bytes. Zero-padding bytes are inserted where necessary.

> Header  
> Table of contents  
> Section 1  
> Section 2  
> â€¦  
> Section n  
> Footer

>   - "mrm_prif": Windows Phone 6.3.1
>   - "mrm_pri2": Universal 10.0.0 (Windows 10)

### Table of Contents

The table of contents provides information about each section in the file. For each section, there is exactly one corresponding entry in the table of contents. Each entry has the following structure:

Offset | Data Type | Description
------ | --------- | -----------
0      | char[16]  | section identifier
16     | uint16    | flags

24     | uint32    | section offset, relative to offset of first section
28     | uint32    | section length

### Sections

Each section consists of a section header, the actual section data and a section footer. If the length of the section data is not a multiple of 8 bytes, appropriate padding is inserted before the section footer. The padding is not counted in any section length fields.

The structure of each section header is as follows:

Offset | Data Type | Description
------ | --------- | -----------
0      | char[16]  | section identifier
16     | uint32    | section qualifier

22     | uint16    | section flags
24     | uint32    | section length
28     | uint32    | unknown, zero

The structure of each section footer is:

Offset | Data Type | Description
------ | --------- | -----------
0      | uint32    | 0xF5DEDEFA
4      | uint32    | section length, as in section header

#### PRI Descriptor Section

The PRI Descriptor Section has the section identifier "[mrm_pridescex]\0" and provides basic information about other sections in the file.

Offset | Data Type | Description
------ | --------- | -----------
0      | uint16    | flags
2      | uint16    | section index of Included File List Section, 0xFFFF if not present

16     | uint16    | number of Data Item Sections in the file
18     | uint16    | unknown, zero

> - **flags**:
>   - bit 0: AutoMerge
>   - bit 1: IsDeploymentMergeable
>   - bit 2: IsDeploymentMergeResult
>   - bit 3: IsAutomergeMergeResult

The section indices of all Hierarchical Schema Sections, Decision Info Sections, Resource Map Sections, Referenced File Sections and Data Item Sections follow in this exact order as uint16s.

#### Hierarchical Schema Section

The Hierarchical Schema Section exists in two versions, a compact one with the section identifier "[mrm_hschema]  \0" and an extended one with the section identifier "[mrm_hschemaex] ". The hierarchical schema consists of a file system-like structure of scopes and items, the items being the logical resources and the scopes describing a directory tree in which the items are organized.

In some files, this section is empty and does not contain any data apart from the common section header and footer.

Offset | Data Type            | Description
------ | -------------------- | -----------
0      | uint16               | unknown, one

> - **unknown at 70 + ?**: only present in the extended Hierarchical Schema Section and if hname identifier is "[def_hnamesx]  \0".

HSCHEMA_VERSION_INFO has the following structure:

Offset | Data Type | Description
------ | --------- | -----------
0      | uint16    | major version

16     | uint32    | number of items

> - **checksum**: a CRC32-based checksum computed on the unique name, the name, the section indices of the Resource Map Section and Data Item Section, and the names of all scopes and items

Names of scopes and items are stored in two blocks, a Unicode name block and an ASCII name block, depending on whether the name can be represented in ASCII or not.

> [!NOTE]
> In the following, any use of the term "index" will refer to the indices of scopes and items as they appear in the following table, while the term "index property" will refer to the property of the same name that each scope and item has.

For each resource name, i.e. scope or item, follows:

Offset | Data Type | Description
------ | --------- | -----------
0      | uint16    | parent scope index

6      | byte      | length of name in characters, null-terminator excluded, 0 if the length is bigger than 255
7      | byte      | flags and upper bits of name offset
8      | uint16    | offset of name in ASCII or Unicode name block in characters
10     | uint16    | index property

> - **flags and upper bits of name offset**:

      bit 4: set if resource name is a scope, unset if it is an item  
      bit 5: set if name is stored in the ASCII name block, unset if it is stored in the Unicode name block
     
For each scope, sorted by the index property, follows:

Offset | Data Type | Description
------ | --------- | -----------
0      | uint16    | scope index
2      | uint16    | child count
4      | uint16    | scope or item index of first child, all other children follow sequentially
6      | uint16    | unknown, zero

For each item, sorted by the index property, follows:

Offset | Data Type | Description
------ | --------- | -----------
0      | uint16    | item index

The Unicode name block and the ASCII name block follow.

#### Decision Info Section

The Decision Info Section has the section identifier "[mrm_decn_info]\0" and stores all resource qualifiers. Qualifiers that appear together for resource candidates (e.g. a candidate may have the qualifiers lang=de-DE and scale=100) are grouped into qualifier sets. A qualifier can be part of more than one qualifier set. Qualifier sets that are specified for different candidates of the same resource item (e.g. a resource item may have candidates for lang=de-DE;scale=100 and lang=en-US;scale=100) are grouped into decisions. A qualifier set can be part of more than one decision. Qualifiers and qualifier sets are referenced through their indices which are stored in a separate index table.

Offset | Data Type | Description
------ | --------- | -----------
0      | uint16    | number of distinct qualifiers
2      | uint16    | number of qualifiers
4      | uint16    | number of qualifier sets
6      | uint16    | number of decisions

The index table follows as an array of uint16s, then the qualifier value block follows. Qualifier values are stored as zero-terminated Unicode strings.

#### Resource Map Section

The Resource Map Section exists in two versions with the section identifiers "[mrm_res_map__]\0" and "[mrm_res_map2_]\0". It assigns to each resource item a decision and a set of candidates. It may contain embedded resource data directly in the section or reference data items in a Data Item Section.

Offset | Data Type | Description
------ | --------- | -----------
0      | uint16    | length of environment references block
2      | uint16    | number of references in environment references block
4      | uint16    | section index of Hierarchical Schema Section

The block of environment references follows. It consists of a sequence of environment references, each 0x22C bytes long. The detailed structure of these is unknown. The number of environment references this block contains must be non-zero for section version 1 ("[mrm_res_map__]\0"), and zero for section version 2 ("[mrm_res_map2_]\0").

The hierarchical schema reference block follows. It has the following structure:

Offset | Data Type            | Description
------ | -------------------- | -----------
0      | HSCHEMA_VERSION_INFO | hierarchical schema version info
20     | uint16               | length of unique id in characters, null-terminator included
22     | uint16               | unknown, zero
24     | uint32               | unknown
28     | uint32               | unknown
32     | wcharz               | unique id

The resource value type table follows. Each entry has the following structure:

Offset | Data Type | Description
------ | --------- | -----------
0      | uint32    | unknown, 4
4      | uint32    | resource value type

> - **resource value type**: valid values are
>   - String (0)
>   - Path (1)
>   - EmbeddedData (2)
>   - AsciiString (3)
>   - Utf8String (4)
>   - AsciiPath (5)
>   - Utf8Path (6)

PRI file version "mrm_pri0" appears to have entries for the first three resource value types only. Later versions have entries for all seven types.

The item to iteminfo group table follows. Each entry has the following structure:

Offset | Data Type | Description
------ | --------- | -----------
0      | uint16    | index property of first resource item
2      | uint16    | index of iteminfo group

> - **index of iteminfo group**: if this value is greater than or equal to the number of item info groups, it encodes a group containing only one iteminfo, namely the iteminfo at index (value - [number of item info groups])

Only the index property of the first resource item is stored. All other resource items have consecutively increasing index properties. The number of resource items is determined by the number of iteminfos in the associated iteminfo group.

The iteminfo group table follows. Each entry has the following structure:

Offset | Data Type | Description
------ | --------- | -----------
0      | uint16    | number of iteminfos in this group
2      | uint16    | index of the first iteminfo in this group

Only the index of the first iteminfo is stored. All other iteminfos have consecutively increasing indices.

The iteminfo table follows. Each entry maps a resource name to a decision and a set of candidates. The index that an entry appears in this table corresponds to the index property of the resource name it is associated with. Each entry has the following structure:

Offset | Data Type | Description
------ | --------- | -----------
0      | uint16    | index of decision
2      | uint16    | index of first candidate

Only the index of the first candidate is stored. All other candidates have consecutively increasing indices. The number of candidates is determined by the number of qualifier sets in the decision.

The table extension block follows. It allows storing entries of the three preceding tables with uint32 data types which would exceed the size of the uint16 data type. The block has the following structure:

Offset | Data Type | Description
------ | --------- | -----------
0      | uint32    | number of additional entries of the item to iteminfo group table
2      | uint32    | number of additional entries of the item info group table
4      | uint32    | number of additional entries of the iteminfo table

Entries for the three tables then follow in the same format as above with the same semantics but using uint32 data types instead of uint16 data types. These entries are to be appended to the respective tables.

For each candidate follows:

Offset | Data Type | Description
------ | --------- | -----------
0      | byte      | candidate type, zero or one

Depending on the candidate type, the resource data is either stored in the embedded data block at the end of this section, or in a Data Item Section in the same or external PRI file.

If the candidate type is zero, the data that follows for the candidate is:

Offset | Data Type | Description
------ | --------- | -----------
1      | byte      | resource value type, specified as an index into the resource value type table
2      | uint16    | embedded data length
4      | uint32    | offset of the embedded data in the embedded data block

If the candidate type is one, the data that follows for the candidate is:

Offset | Data Type | Description
------ | --------- | -----------
1      | byte      | resource value type, specified as an index into the resource value type table
2      | uint16    | source file
4      | uint16    | index of the data item storing the data
6      | uint16    | section index of the Data Item Section storing the data

> - **source file**: zero if the specified Data Item Section is located in the same file, else 1 + the index of a file path in a Referenced File Section that points to an external PRI file which contains the data

Candidates of type zero seem to only appear in PRI file version "mrm_pri0".

The embedded data block follows.

#### Data Item Section

The Data Item Section has the section identifier "[mrm_dataitem] \0" and stores resource data.

Offset | Data Type | Description

0      | uint32    | unknown, zero
4      | uint16    | number of stored strings
6      | uint16    | number of stored blobs
8      | uint32    | total length of stored data

Data items are either strings (for short textual data) or blobs (for binary data). Data items are referenced from other sections by their index which is defined by the order in which they appear in the tables below (strings have lower indices than blobs).

For each stored string follows:

Offset | Data Type | Description
------ | --------- | -----------
0      | uint16    | string offset, relative to start of stored data
2      | uint16    | string length in bytes

For each stored blob follows:

Offset | Data Type | Description
------ | --------- | -----------
0      | uint32    | blob offset, relative to start of stored data
4      | uint32    | blob length in bytes

All stored data follows.
